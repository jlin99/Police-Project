# Police-Project
A personal project meant to help me learn Python. I wanted to explore what defunding the police and abolishing the police could look like as someone who feels rather strongly about the recent and rather tragic events in regards to BLM protests. 

I typed up a report [here](https://medium.com/@johnsonlin_32600/what-could-defund-the-police-look-like-df32fe6f5d96). I unfortunately lost the updated code as my MacBook died soon after finishing the project.
